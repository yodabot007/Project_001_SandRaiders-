# TODO — Project_001_SandRaiders

## Must-have (Prototype)
- [ ] Rename player + enemy and adjust story intro text
- [ ] Add 1 more enemy type with different speed/HP
- [ ] Add a simple "Boss" at Score 15
- [ ] Add sound effects (coin + hit)
- [ ] Add a start screen and restart without refreshing

## Nice-to-have
- [ ] Add real sprite PNGs into /assets/sprites (replace placeholders)
- [ ] Add a health bar (not just HP number)
- [ ] Add a dash move (Shift) with cooldown
- [ ] Add a small map / camera shake on hit

## CEO Notes
- Game type: top-down arena
- Core loop: collect → survive → upgrade → boss
